## Checkout the different branches in this order:
1.  `master` - sets up the canvas and places a box in the middle that does not move.
2.  `canvas_with_moving_box` - uses `setInterval`, `clearRect`, and `fillRect` to create an animation of the box moving across the canvas.
3.  `canvas_with_keypress` - sets up an event listener and move function to enable drawing with directional keys.
4.  `canvas_with_keypress_change_box_color` - uses `fillStyle` to set the pen color.
